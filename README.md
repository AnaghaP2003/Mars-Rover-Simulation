# Mars-Rover-Simulation

What the Project Does?

This project simulates the movement of a Mars Rover on a grid-based terrain. The Rover can move forward, turn left, and turn right, while detecting and avoiding obstacles. The Rover navigates the grid based on a series of commands and can also provide a status report with its current position and direction.

Why the Project is Useful?

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming concepts and design patterns like the Command and Composite patterns. It showcases how to structure a simulation using clean and maintainable code while handling movement, obstacle detection, and reporting, making it a great example for learning OOP and design patterns.

Features:

- The Rover can move forward ('M'), turn left ('L'), or turn right ('R') based on commands.
- Obstacle detection prevents the Rover from moving into occupied grid spaces.
- The grid is designed using the Composite Pattern, while the Command Pattern encapsulates the movement commands.
- The Rover is initialized with a starting position and direction (N, S, E, W).
- Report provides the Rover's current position and direction.

How Users Can Get Started?

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Compile and run the project using any Java IDE or command line.
- Modify the grid size, Roverâ€™s starting position, commands, or obstacles to experiment with different scenarios.
- Execute the commands to see how the Rover moves and interacts with obstacles, and check the status report.
